# rscripts
Python scripts for RS3. Decided to move the C++ versions over to Python for some more experience with Python. simplicity, and much less garbage code. The C++ versions are an absolute nightmare. If you have any specific requests of what you'd like to see, feel free to message me **offline#9516**. I am starting to work on implementing OpenCV in order to create much more advanced scripts than what was created in the C++ version.
