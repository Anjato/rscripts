# rscripts
Python scripts for RS3 and OSRS. Decided to move the C++ versions over to Python for some more experience with Python and simplicity. If you have any specific requests of what you'd like to see, feel free to message me **offline#9516**. I may eventually implement OpenCV but currently don't have the time for it.
