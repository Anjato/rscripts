# rscripts
Python scripts for RS3 and OSRS. Decided to move the C++ versions over to Python for some more experience with Python. simplicity, and much less garbage code. The C++ versions are an absolute nightmare. If you have any specific requests of what you'd like to see, feel free to message me **offline#9516**. I may eventually implement OpenCV in order to create some much more advanced scripts but I unfortunately don't have the time for it.
